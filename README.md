# SEO solution for your Single page applications

## Problem
```
You have a SPA and you want to put dynamic information (most likely from an API call) in HTML meta tags, so that when you share a particular link from your SPA website on some social media, it displays all the relevant information.
```
## Solution
```
1- A browser requests your single page application, which is going to be loaded from a single index.html file.
2- You differentiate whether the request came from a browser or some social media bot.
